# genetic_algorithms_paired_hamiltonian
The code implements a genetic algorithm using Python's DEAP library to optimize the parameters of a paired Hamiltonian. It encodes potential solutions as binary strings, evolving these through selection, crossover, and mutation to find the optimal Hamiltonian configuration.
